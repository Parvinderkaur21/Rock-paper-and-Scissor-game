# Snake-paper-and-Scissor-game
In this repository , I have written python code for snake , paper and scissor game.
There will be match between player and the computer.
There will be five rounds in total.
Points will be given to the player who win.
In case of tie match , both computer and player will be given each point.
The one who has more points at the end will be consider winner.

I have used Random module in this.
It is a beginner level project based on if-else conditions and for loop.
